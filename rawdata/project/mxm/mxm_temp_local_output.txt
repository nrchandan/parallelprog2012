MXM
  C/OpenMP version.

  Matrix multiplication tests.

  Number of processors available = 16
  Number of threads =              12
  Scheduling Policy =              Dynamic
  Chunk Size =                     1

R8_MXM matrix multiplication timing.
  A(LxN) = B(LxM) * C(MxN).
  L = 2000
  M = 2000
  N = 2000
  Floating point OPS roughly -1179869184
  Elapsed time dT = 16.300430
  Rate = MegaOPS/dT = -72.382701

MXM:
  Normal end of execution.
